[decision.no_leptos_no_dioxus]
reason = "Leptos and Dioxus are reactive UI frameworks designed for component trees and DOM diffing. \
          This project's hot path is a 200x200 grid (~40,000 cells) updating at 60 FPS on a Canvas element, \
          which bypasses the DOM entirely. Reactive signals have no value here — there are no components to diff. \
          The frameworks add compile time, bundle size, and an awkward ownership split between \
          the framework's render cycle and the Canvas's requestAnimationFrame loop. \
          Vanilla JS calling into WASM directly is simpler, faster, and better demonstrates \
          Rust's systems value without framework noise."

frontend = "Vanilla JS"
rationale = "Zero overhead, direct WASM memory access, single clear owner of the render loop."
